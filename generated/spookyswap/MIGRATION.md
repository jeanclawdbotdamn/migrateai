# Migration Guide: SpookySwap
## Ethereum → Solana
*Generated by MigrateAI on 2026-02-12*

## What Was Generated

This Anchor project contains scaffolding for migrating the following contract types:
- **ERC-20**
- **AMM/DEX**
- **Staking**
- **--write**

## EVM → Solana Key Concepts

| EVM Concept | Solana Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Contract storage | Account data (PDAs) |
| msg.sender | Signer constraint |
| require() | Anchor constraints + #[error_code] |
| Events | emit! macro |
| block.timestamp | Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp |
| mapping(address => X) | PDA per key (seeds = [user.key()]) |
| ERC-20 balances | Associated Token Accounts |
| approve/transferFrom | Delegate + CPI to SPL Token |
| Reentrancy guard | Not needed (single-threaded) |
| Gas optimization | Compute Unit optimization |
| Constructor | initialize instruction |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

## Bridge Setup (Wormhole NTT)

If you need to bridge tokens from Ethereum:

1. Edit `ntt/deployment.json` with your token addresses
2. Follow Wormhole NTT docs: https://wormhole.com/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/
3. Deploy NTT Manager on both chains
4. Configure rate limits

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Replace placeholder program ID with your deployed ID
2. [ ] Implement remaining business logic in each instruction
3. [ ] Add comprehensive tests
4. [ ] Run `anchor verify` before mainnet deployment
5. [ ] Get a security audit (recommended: OtterSec, Sec3, Neodyme)
